## Answering a few questions

### What can I do with this?

I'm glad you asked! With **That's The Way You Do It** you can create beautiful markdown tutorials in a fast way, focusing on the writing instead of on the copying and pasting. 

### Just it? What differs this project from other markdown editors?

Oh, silly person on the other side of the screen, there's one key feature that make **That's The Way You Do It** unique!

You can **import code from GitHub to the editor seamlessly**!

### Whaaaaaaaat!?

Yeah, on **That's The Way You Do It** you can import code from:

- **Files** hosted on GitHub repos (or just some lines of it)
- **Changes** from commits
- And even changes from **pull requests**

### And how can I do that?

Simple: 

**paste the link of what you whant and the editor grabs the code for you**
